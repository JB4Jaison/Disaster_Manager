# Disaster_Manager
Codefundo++ Challenge on Prediction and Mitigation of natural disasters
In this project we try to build a model for analysis and prediction of the effect of a natural disaster on a particular area. We aim to deploy an interactive website with the model results and the analysis obtained from the dataset to help in disaster prevention and mitigation.
A deeper analysis into the major problems that an area faces based on the previous data collected in these areas helps in channelling the resources to the appropraite areas for preventing losses in the future. For example an increased cause of casualities during a disaster may be as result of poor preparedness amongst the population for the disaster or an increased no of buildings damaged may lead to a conclusion of poor infrastructure in the area. In analysing these factors we can take effective and appropriate measures to prevent or reduce futher losses.
We plan on obtaining data from the SENDAI framework created by UNISDR for disaster risk reduction.
Technologies used include - python , HTML , CSS , JavaScript, Azure
